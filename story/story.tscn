text = "This is your first day at your new job - managing the Cursed Hotel. You're not sure why someone would call it Cursed, but you assume it's just bad marketing.

Nobody ever told you why the previous guy left, but at your new desk, you find a letter. Curious, you open it:



\"Hello, new guy or gal.

I wish you good luck. You should know that the name is not the only cursed thing about this place. The walls crack roughly every 10 seconds around here! I'm not kidding.

Send your team to fix it when that happens - the customers don't like it. And when customers are not satisfied, that's bad for business. You might get fired for it.

Also find a therapist. This place can drive you nuts.

Best regards,
The previous guy.\"



You pause for a moment after reading. Is this a prank? Surely it isn't that bad!. Let's find out!"
